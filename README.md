This is the starting point for the Mars Rover Kata in dotnet 8

## Optional: Use a DevContainer

Install Plugin "Devcontainers" from Marketplace in Visual Studio Code

Devcontainer configuration is checked into source control.
Command in VS Code to connect to Dev Container: 

```
# Strg Shift P in Windows
# Cmd Shift P in Mac
Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
```

Please make sure, that "mob moo" inside the console of the container delivers the output "moo"
